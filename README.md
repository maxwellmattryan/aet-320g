# AET 320G - Audio Coding I
## About
AET 320G is a class taught by Dr. Ozley from the University of Texas at Austin. The class explores MAX/MSP and what sort of implications it has on performing and creating sound or audio. I would say that this class reinforces the programmatic style of thinking and the ability to follow a signal, which are both vital to a software engineer's metaphorical "toolkit". The algorithm design skills needed to make max patches are quite handy when wanting to implement something in C++.
